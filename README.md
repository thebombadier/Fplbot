I've written a bot that crowdsources  data from the daily RMT threads on this sub to create a fantasy team.

It works by taking a sample of comments each day and checking for the most popular players (e.g. Salah, Sterling etc.). Then it  creates a team by maximizing for the popularity of players within RMT threads. Every week one day before the deadline it will develop a new team based on the crowdsourced data. 

In a sense this team tries to best represent the group-think of this subreddit and in a way is the collective team of this subreddit. That's why i decided to call it [rslashFantasyPL](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/2416342/history) . 


The current team from a day of data is in the file team.csv. I haven't got round to updating the changing contents of the spreadsheet to github yet but will get round to it soon and then you'll be able to see populiary data in fpl.csv and the top 30 players of each week in dreamteam.csv.

The current team is [here](https://i.redd.it/pu1a3tggv7e31.png)

Total Price: Â£95.5
Total Mentions in RMT thread: 3730

There is 4.5 mil in the bank since the program privileges popularity over price. This is something that with my skills and time constraints I don't think I'll be able to fix but if anyone would want to help they are more than welcome.
